Students will learn the theory and application of techniques such as: matching, difference-in-differences, instrumental variables, experiments, and regression discontinuity. However, the primary goal of this course is not to provide a ready-to-use \"toolbox\" of statistical methods. It is to study the more generalizable process of developing identification strategies to answer critical questions in the social sciences. Students will become critical consumers of empirical research, and in doing so, learn how to both harness the full power, and recognize the limitations, of their own research designs.\n\n### Required Materials\n\n#### Required Text\n\nRequired texts for the course: - Nick Huntington-Klein. 2021.

The coding language for Stata is very simple, clear, and straight forward, so it serves as a good entry point to getting comfortable using programming languages for analyzing data and learning more about the world around us. Once you adjust to the basics of analysis with an easy and intuitive coding language like Stata, transitioning to other software languages (e.g., R, Python in industry; SAS, SQL in government) will be much less onerous.\n\nYou may also use R for the course with the understanding that I am less familiar with R and less able to help should you run into trouble.\n\nZotero - Zotero is a free platform for organizing and sharing academic work and it is how readings will be distributed to the class. You can download the app [here](https://www.zotero.org/download/). I suggest also downloading the browser connector for whatever browser you use - it helps save a dramatic amount of time when conducting a literature review. During the first week of classes you will receive an invitation to join the class Zotero library. If you do not receive one, please email the professor. I provide an introduction to Zotero and the features most applicable to this class in the embedded video below.\n\n::: callout-note\nThere are a variety of citation organizer software options out there for researchers to use and, having experimented with most of them, Zotero is by far the best.

An individual assignment to produce a segment of the analysis for the case study final report.\n2.  A group assignment to produce a final report - a section of which will be drawn from the individual assignment.\n\nUnlike most courses, this course is ensuring an application and synthesis of program skills and materials. As a result, there are not weekly modules and not necessarily new skills or content taught week to week. Instead, we will follow a biweekly meeting schedule (see detailed course schedule below) and most meetings will allow for groups to coordinate their work in-person and ask any questions they might have of the instructor.\n\n## Assignments\n\n### Overview\n\nThe following assignments will form the basis of your grade in this course:\n\n1.  Problem Sets (40 points)\n2.  Empirical Paper (40 points)\n3.  Participation (20 points)\n\n::: callout-important\nAll assignments will be turned in via Brightspace.\n:::\n\n### Problem Sets\n\nYou will complete four problem sets over the course of the semester that will test your knowledge of and ability to apply the research designs and statistical estimators covered in the course readings. While students may work together on the problem sets, they are responsible for writing their own work that is ultimately submitted for grading. Copying the work of other students will be considered academic dishonesty.\n\n::: callout-warning\nDo not use commercial LLMs for any assignments in this class. Beyond cheating yourselves of the practice required to learn and build these skills that will be critical to your career as researchers, I will treat the use of generative AI/LLMs as academic dishonesty should I discover it.\n:::\n\n### Empirical Paper\n\nOne of the goals of this class is to use your time in the course to develop a research paper that can be revised into a publication quality research manuscript using the skills learned in the course. For students in the Department of Public Administration and Policy, the course assignment is can double as an opportunity to develop a paper that can fulfill the empirical paper requirement for candidacy and even serve as a chapter in your eventual dissertation.\n\nA written paper proposal and accompanying 12 minute presentation is due **October 15th** that should include a well-motivated research question that you will answer, a research design for answering the question, and a dataset that can be used to fulfill the need of the research design. This will account for 10 points of the final paper grade and allow the opportunity to practice conference-style presentation of your work and opportunities for feedback.\n\nYour final paper will be due **December 3rd**. You will submit via Brightspace and will submit the final draft of your paper and replication materials (data and code to replicate the results with minimal effort) following the [TIER protocol](https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/protocol-4-0/).\n\n### Participation\n\nStudents are expected to attend class every week and participate in class discussions. In addition, when applied readings are assigned, students will submit a journal entry identifying the research question of the paper, the structure of the data used in answering the question, the assumptions made for identifying the main effects in the paper, and any critiques that come to mind. Students should also prepare at least one question to submit for the class discussion. These will be due by midnight on the Tuesday before the class on which the reading will be discussed. Each journal entry is work 2 points and will be submitted via Brightspace. Students have a flexible free skip they can use for any given week and still receive credit for the week.\n\n## Class Schedule\n\n### Overview of Weeks {#sec-overview.weeks}\n\nKey:\n\n| Symbol | Meaning                                                            |\n|:------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------|\n|  👨‍🏫:   | Lecture                                                            |\n|  ✅:   | Problem Set Assigned (due before the next class)                   |\n|  ✍️:   | Journal Assigned                                                   |\n|  📅:   | Paper Proposal or Final Draft Due                                  |\n|  📄:   | Reading is from an article/chapter on Zotero (by author last name) |\n|  📖:   | Reading is from course texts                                       |\n\n| Date | Topic | Assignments | Readings |\n|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|\n| 8/27 | Intro to course | 👨‍🏫 | 📖 [The Effect Chapter 4](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-DescribingRelationships.html) <br> 📖 [The Effect Chapter 5](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-Identification.html) |\n| 9/3 | Models of Causality | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅|  📖 The Effect Chapter 6 <br> 📖 The Effect Chapter 7 <br> 📖 The Effect Chapter 8 <br> 📄 Walter & Fisher 1988 |\n| 9/10 | Randomized Experiments | 👨‍🏫 | 📄 National Academies of SEM: <br> Appendices A and C |\n| 9/17 | Summarizing Data I | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅ <br> 👥 | 📄 Huntington-Klein |\n| 9/24 | Summarizing Data II | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅ <br> 👥 |  |\n| 10/1 | Data Management I | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅ <br> 👥 | 📄 Kroenke & Auer (Ch. 1 & 2) |\n| 10/15 | Fall Break | Meet with Professor |  |\n| 10/22 | Midterm Exam | 📅 |  |\n| 10/29 | Geographic Information and Mapping Data | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅ <br> 👥 |  |\n| 11/5 | Writing About Data | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅ <br> 👥 |  |\n| 11/12 | Light Statistics Introduction | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅ <br> 👥 |  |\n| 11/19 | Statistical Models I | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅ <br> 👥 |  |\n| 11/26 | Thanksgiving Break | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅ <br> 👥 |  |\n| 12/3 | Synthetic Control | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅ <br>📅 |  |\n\n## Class Policies\n\n-   Public policy is a professional field; therefore, I emphasize professional skills in the classroom and assignments. Professional skills are punctuality, adhering to deadlines, and preparedness.\n-   Letters of recommendation. If you are a hard working student and serious about a career in public service, I will be a dedicated advocate for you on the job market and will happily write letters of recommendation on your behalf. There is, however, one condition and one recommendation. The condition: I will not write a letter of recommendation for your while you are in my class. This is because to write a good faith, sincere, and thoughtful recommendation, I will need to be able to consider your work as a whole, and while the class is on-going, my assessment of you will be incomplete. After the semester is over, I am happy to help in any way I can, including writing letters. The recommendation: Make an appointment to visit my office hours at least once over the course of the semester to talk informally about your goals, career interests, and other professional ambitions so I can get a better sense of who you are as individuals. The better I know you, the more effective I can be at writing letters on your behalf and thinking of you when opportunities arise.\n-   I have a strict open door policy. If there is anything about the course, the assignments, the grading, the material, class, or anything related to public administration/policy or statistics broadly that you would like to discuss, do not hesitate to visit me during office hours or email me. I can respond via email, schedule a phone call, or schedule a separate meeting. I am here to help, so please do not hesitate to reach out to me. (But please be respectful of my time!)\n-   **HAVE FUN!** Public administration/policy is a broad topic that explores big, important questions that affect everyone. Discussing these topics should be as fun and interesting as it is challenging.\n-   The table below lays out the grading scale that will be used in assigning final course grades.\n-   Students with special physical and/or learning needs will be accommodated. Please notify the Disabilities Office and me as soon as possible so that reasonable accommodations can be made.\n\n::: callout-important\n**NOTE:** Throughout the semester, I may add or subtract readings as needed to adjust the course according to your progress, engagement, and interests.\n:::\n\nTable. Grade Scale Used for Calculating Class Grades\n\n| Percent | Grade | Points |\n|:-------:|:-----:|:------:|\n| 93-100  |   A   |  4.0   |\n|  90-92  |  A-   |  3.7   |\n|  87-89  |  B+   |  3.3   |\n|  83-86  |   B   |  3.0   |\n|  80-82  |  B-   |  2.7   |\n|  77-79  |  C+   |  2.3   |\n|  73-76  |   C   |  2.0   |\n|  70-72  |  C-   |  1.7   |\n|  67-69  |  D+   |  1.3   |\n|  63-66  |   D   |  1.0   |\n|  60-62  |  D-   |  0.7   |\n|  \\< 60  |   F   |  0.0   |\n\n::: callout-note\n**Note:** the percent refers to the percent of available weighted points earned. Each assignment is weighted by the proportion of the final grade made up by the assignment itself, as described above.\n:::\n\n### Academic integrity\n\nAcademic honesty is something your professor takes very seriously. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated. Students are required to be familiar with the university's academic honesty policies; ignorance is not an excuse for dishonest behavior. In all cases of cheating, a Violation of Academic Integrity Report will be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies to be placed in your university file, with copies provided to you, the department head, and the Dean of Rockefeller College. Additional penalties may include some combination of the following: revision and re-submission of the assignment, reduction of the grade or failure of the assignment, reduction of the course grade or failure of the course, filing of a case with the Office of Conflict Resolution and Civic Responsibility, suspension, or expulsion. For a more detailed description of the university's academic honesty policies, visit the [site](http://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/requirements_degree.htm#standards_integrity).\n\n### Students with Disabilities\n\nWe are committed to providing an accessible learning environment for all students. This includes students with physical, sensory, medical, cognitive, learning, mental health, and other disabilities. If you have, or think you may have a disability, please contact Disability Access and Inclusion Student Services (DAISS) by emailing daiss\\@albany.edu or calling 518 -442-5501. DAISS staff will explain the documentation and registration process, and set you up with an appointment. Once you have completed registration, you will be provided with a letter to inform your instructors that you are a student with a disability registered with DAISS, and which lists the recommended reasonable accommodations for your courses.\n\n### Counseling Center\n\nThe Counseling Center (518-442-5800; 400 Patroon Creek Blvd, Suite 104) offers counseling and consultations regarding personal concerns, self-help information, and connections to off-campus resources. More information can be found at their [site](http://www.albany.edu/counseling_center/index.shtml).\n\n### Library Assistance\n\nSUNY-Albany offers a great collection available in several different media. Access to research help and library tutorials can be found online at the [library's site](http://library.albany.edu/).\n\nFor information about SUNY-Albany's Dewey Graduate Library, which is located on the Downtown Campus, visit their [site](http://library.albany.edu/dewey?source=drop).\n\n### Writing Center\n\nThe university offers a number of services for students who need assistance with writing and research projects. Support is available in the Writing Center (518-442-4061; 140 HU) and at the University Library. Information about the Writing Center can be found at their [site](http://www.albany.edu/writing/index.html).\n\n### Title IX and Sexual Violence Prevention\n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs and activities. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies prohibit offenses defined as sexual harassment, sexual assault, intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence), sexual exploitation, and stalking. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies apply to the entire University at Albany community, including students, faculty, and staff of all gender identities. The University at Albany provides a variety of resources for support and advocacy to assist individuals who have experienced sexual offenses.\n\nConfidential support and guidance can be found through the Counseling Center (518-442-5800, [or online](https://www.albany.edu/counseling_center/)), the University Health Center (518-442-5454, [or online](https://www.albany.edu/health_center/)), and the Interfaith Center (518-489-8573, [or online](https://www.albany.edu/spirituality/onCampus.shtml)). Individuals at these locations will not report crimes to law enforcement or university officials without permission, except for in extreme circumstances, such as a health and/or safety emergency. Additionally, the Advocates at the University at Albany's Advocacy Center for Sexual Violence are available to assist students without sharing information that could identify them (518-442-CARE, [or online](https://www.albany.edu/advocacycenter/)).\n\nSexual offenses can be reported non-confidentially to the Title IX Coordinator within The Office for Equity and Compliance (518-442-3800, [or online](https://www.albany.edu/equity-compliance/), Building 25, Room 117) and/or the University Police Department (518-442-3131, [or online](http://police.albany.edu/)).\n\n::: callout-important\n**PLEASE NOTE:** Faculty members are considered \"responsible employees\" at the University at Albany, meaning that they are required to report all known relevant details about a complaint of sexual violence to the University's Title IX Coordinator, including names of anyone involved or present, date, time, and location.\n:::\n\nIn case of an emergency, please call 911.\n\n### Incomplete Grade Policy\n\nA tentative grade given only when the student has nearly completed the course but due to circumstances beyond the student's control the work is not completed on schedule. The date for the completion of the work is specified by the instructor. The date stipulated will not be later than one month before the end of the session following that in which the Incomplete is received. The grade I is automatically changed to E or U unless work is completed as agreed between the student and the instructor.\n\n### Absence due to religious observance\n\nStudents are excused, without penalty, to be absent because of religious beliefs, and will be provided equivalent opportunities for make-up examinations, study, or work requirements missed because of such absences. Students should notify the instructor of record in a timely manner, and the instructor will work directly with students to accommodate religious observances. Online courses will not schedule any assignment deadlines on religious holidays.\n\n## Appendix {#sec-appendix}\n\n### NASPAA Competencies\n\n### Competency 1: Ability to lead and manage in the public interest\n\n-   Manage teams and projects effectively, fairly, and with attention to detail.\n-   Display responsible stewardship of public resources and use of discretion by recognizing consequences of choices.\n\n### Competency 2: To participate in and contribute to the policy process\n\n-   Inform the design, implementation, and/or evaluation of policy.\n-   Identify and manage stakeholder interests and expectations within existing constraints to achieve policy goals.\n\n### Competency 3: To analyze, synthesize, think critically, solve problems and make decisions\n\n-   Use appropriate data and approaches to inform policy and management recommendations.\n-   Clearly present and interpret findings from data analysis.\n-   Communicate limitations from data collection and analysis.\n\n### Competency 4: To articulate and apply a public service perspective\n\n-   Incorporate, where appropriate, the values of equity, accountability, and participation in decision-making and the evaluation of policies.\n-   Foster public trust by identifying and minimizing conflicts of interest and adhering to high standards of integrity.\n\n### Competency 5: To communicate and interact productively with a diverse and changing workforce and citizenry\n\n-   Present information, in writing and orally, that is concise, accurate, clear, and informed by evidence.\n-   Tailor information to diverse audiences.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Quantitative Methods of Causal Inference\n\n## RPAD 725\n\n👨‍🏫: Stephen Holt, Ph.D.\\\n📅: Wednesdays, 4:30pm - 7:20pm\\\n📧: sbholt\\@albany.edu\\\n🏫: Mondays and Thursdays from 3:00 pm to 5:00 pm or by appointment - book [here](https://calendly.com/sbholt/30min); in-person in Milne 324 or online in [Zoom](https://albany.zoom.us/my/sbholt).\\\n☎️: 518-442-3309\n\n## Course Description\n\nThis course addresses the ubiquitous challenge in empirical research of navigating the path from cause to effect.

Students have a flexible free skip they can use for any given week and still receive credit for the week.\n\n## Class Schedule\n\n### Overview of Weeks {#sec-overview.weeks}\n\nKey:\n\n| Symbol | Meaning                                                            |\n|:------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------|\n|  👨‍🏫:   | Lecture                                                            |\n|  ✅:   | Problem Set Assigned (due before the next class)                   |\n|  ✍️:   | Journal Assigned                                                   |\n|  📅:   | Paper Proposal or Final Draft Due                                  |\n|  📄:   | Reading is from an article/chapter on Zotero (by author last name) |\n|  📖:   | Reading is from course texts                                       |\n\n| Date | Topic | Assignments | Readings |\n|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|\n| 8/27 | Intro to course | 👨‍🏫 | 📖 [The Effect Chapter 4](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-DescribingRelationships.html) <br> 📖 [The Effect Chapter 5](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-Identification.html) |\n| 9/3 | Models of Causality | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅|  📖 The Effect Chapter 6 <br> 📖 The Effect Chapter 7 <br> 📖 The Effect Chapter 8 <br> 📄 Walter & Fisher 1988 |\n| 9/10 | Randomized Experiments | 👨‍🏫 | 📄 National Academies of SEM: <br> Appendices A and C |\n| 9/17 | Summarizing Data I | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅ <br> 👥 | 📄 Huntington-Klein |\n| 9/24 | Summarizing Data II | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅ <br> 👥 |  |\n| 10/1 | Data Management I | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅ <br> 👥 | 📄 Kroenke & Auer (Ch. 1 & 2) |\n| 10/15 | Fall Break | Meet with Professor |  |\n| 10/22 | Midterm Exam | 📅 |  |\n| 10/29 | Geographic Information and Mapping Data | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅ <br> 👥 |  |\n| 11/5 | Writing About Data | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅ <br> 👥 |  |\n| 11/12 | Light Statistics Introduction | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅ <br> 👥 |  |\n| 11/19 | Statistical Models I | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅ <br> 👥 |  |\n| 11/26 | Thanksgiving Break | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅ <br> 👥 |  |\n| 12/3 | Synthetic Control | 👨‍🏫 <br> ✅ <br>📅 |  |\n\n## Class Policies\n\n-   Public policy is a professional field; therefore, I emphasize professional skills in the classroom and assignments. Professional skills are punctuality, adhering to deadlines, and preparedness.\n-   Letters of recommendation. If you are a hard working student and serious about a career in public service, I will be a dedicated advocate for you on the job market and will happily write letters of recommendation on your behalf. There is, however, one condition and one recommendation. The condition: I will not write a letter of recommendation for your while you are in my class. This is because to write a good faith, sincere, and thoughtful recommendation, I will need to be able to consider your work as a whole, and while the class is on-going, my assessment of you will be incomplete. After the semester is over, I am happy to help in any way I can, including writing letters. The recommendation: Make an appointment to visit my office hours at least once over the course of the semester to talk informally about your goals, career interests, and other professional ambitions so I can get a better sense of who you are as individuals. The better I know you, the more effective I can be at writing letters on your behalf and thinking of you when opportunities arise.\n-   I have a strict open door policy. If there is anything about the course, the assignments, the grading, the material, class, or anything related to public administration/policy or statistics broadly that you would like to discuss, do not hesitate to visit me during office hours or email me. I can respond via email, schedule a phone call, or schedule a separate meeting. I am here to help, so please do not hesitate to reach out to me. (But please be respectful of my time!)\n-   **HAVE FUN!** Public administration/policy is a broad topic that explores big, important questions that affect everyone. Discussing these topics should be as fun and interesting as it is challenging.\n-   The table below lays out the grading scale that will be used in assigning final course grades.\n-   Students with special physical and/or learning needs will be accommodated. Please notify the Disabilities Office and me as soon as possible so that reasonable accommodations can be made.\n\n::: callout-important\n**NOTE:** Throughout the semester, I may add or subtract readings as needed to adjust the course according to your progress, engagement, and interests.\n:::\n\nTable. Grade Scale Used for Calculating Class Grades\n\n| Percent | Grade | Points |\n|:-------:|:-----:|:------:|\n| 93-100  |   A   |  4.0   |\n|  90-92  |  A-   |  3.7   |\n|  87-89  |  B+   |  3.3   |\n|  83-86  |   B   |  3.0   |\n|  80-82  |  B-   |  2.7   |\n|  77-79  |  C+   |  2.3   |\n|  73-76  |   C   |  2.0   |\n|  70-72  |  C-   |  1.7   |\n|  67-69  |  D+   |  1.3   |\n|  63-66  |   D   |  1.0   |\n|  60-62  |  D-   |  0.7   |\n|  \\< 60  |   F   |  0.0   |\n\n::: callout-note\n**Note:** the percent refers to the percent of available weighted points earned. Each assignment is weighted by the proportion of the final grade made up by the assignment itself, as described above.\n:::\n\n### Academic integrity\n\nAcademic honesty is something your professor takes very seriously. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated. Students are required to be familiar with the university's academic honesty policies; ignorance is not an excuse for dishonest behavior. In all cases of cheating, a Violation of Academic Integrity Report will be submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies to be placed in your university file, with copies provided to you, the department head, and the Dean of Rockefeller College. Additional penalties may include some combination of the following: revision and re-submission of the assignment, reduction of the grade or failure of the assignment, reduction of the course grade or failure of the course, filing of a case with the Office of Conflict Resolution and Civic Responsibility, suspension, or expulsion. For a more detailed description of the university's academic honesty policies, visit the [site](http://www.albany.edu/graduatebulletin/requirements_degree.htm#standards_integrity).\n\n### Students with Disabilities\n\nWe are committed to providing an accessible learning environment for all students. This includes students with physical, sensory, medical, cognitive, learning, mental health, and other disabilities. If you have, or think you may have a disability, please contact Disability Access and Inclusion Student Services (DAISS) by emailing daiss\\@albany.edu or calling 518 -442-5501. DAISS staff will explain the documentation and registration process, and set you up with an appointment. Once you have completed registration, you will be provided with a letter to inform your instructors that you are a student with a disability registered with DAISS, and which lists the recommended reasonable accommodations for your courses.\n\n### Counseling Center\n\nThe Counseling Center (518-442-5800; 400 Patroon Creek Blvd, Suite 104) offers counseling and consultations regarding personal concerns, self-help information, and connections to off-campus resources. More information can be found at their [site](http://www.albany.edu/counseling_center/index.shtml).\n\n### Library Assistance\n\nSUNY-Albany offers a great collection available in several different media. Access to research help and library tutorials can be found online at the [library's site](http://library.albany.edu/).\n\nFor information about SUNY-Albany's Dewey Graduate Library, which is located on the Downtown Campus, visit their [site](http://library.albany.edu/dewey?source=drop).\n\n### Writing Center\n\nThe university offers a number of services for students who need assistance with writing and research projects. Support is available in the Writing Center (518-442-4061; 140 HU) and at the University Library. Information about the Writing Center can be found at their [site](http://www.albany.edu/writing/index.html).\n\n### Title IX and Sexual Violence Prevention\n\nTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs and activities. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies prohibit offenses defined as sexual harassment, sexual assault, intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence), sexual exploitation, and stalking. The SUNY-wide Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Policies apply to the entire University at Albany community, including students, faculty, and staff of all gender identities. The University at Albany provides a variety of resources for support and advocacy to assist individuals who have experienced sexual offenses.\n\nConfidential support and guidance can be found through the Counseling Center (518-442-5800, [or online](https://www.albany.edu/counseling_center/)), the University Health Center (518-442-5454, [or online](https://www.albany.edu/health_center/)), and the Interfaith Center (518-489-8573, [or online](https://www.albany.edu/spirituality/onCampus.shtml)). Individuals at these locations will not report crimes to law enforcement or university officials without permission, except for in extreme circumstances, such as a health and/or safety emergency. Additionally, the Advocates at the University at Albany's Advocacy Center for Sexual Violence are available to assist students without sharing information that could identify them (518-442-CARE, [or online](https://www.albany.edu/advocacycenter/)).\n\nSexual offenses can be reported non-confidentially to the Title IX Coordinator within The Office for Equity and Compliance (518-442-3800, [or online](https://www.albany.edu/equity-compliance/), Building 25, Room 117) and/or the University Police Department (518-442-3131, [or online](http://police.albany.edu/)).\n\n::: callout-important\n**PLEASE NOTE:** Faculty members are considered \"responsible employees\" at the University at Albany, meaning that they are required to report all known relevant details about a complaint of sexual violence to the University's Title IX Coordinator, including names of anyone involved or present, date, time, and location.\n:::\n\nIn case of an emergency, please call 911.\n\n### Incomplete Grade Policy\n\nA tentative grade given only when the student has nearly completed the course but due to circumstances beyond the student's control the work is not completed on schedule. The date for the completion of the work is specified by the instructor. The date stipulated will not be later than one month before the end of the session following that in which the Incomplete is received. The grade I is automatically changed to E or U unless work is completed as agreed between the student and the instructor.\n\n### Absence due to religious observance\n\nStudents are excused, without penalty, to be absent because of religious beliefs, and will be provided equivalent opportunities for make-up examinations, study, or work requirements missed because of such absences. Students should notify the instructor of record in a timely manner, and the instructor will work directly with students to accommodate religious observances. Online courses will not schedule any assignment deadlines on religious holidays.\n\n## Appendix {#sec-appendix}\n\n### NASPAA Competencies\n\n### Competency 1: Ability to lead and manage in the public
